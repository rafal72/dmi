Update instructions for Tatooine/T+ 2x4 nodes. Do NOT use on any other platform.

To dump all the current DMI and BMC info

cd tatooine_reset
./tatooine_reset_to_node_type

The above command will save off and dump the current DMI and BMC info using SuperMicro's tools.

./tatooine_reset_to_node_type H###[CES](#####)(-NE)

If you are running on a new build of ember where the node type is already recognized, you can cut/copy this to minimize human error:

./tatooine_reset_to_node_type $(jq -r .nodeType /sf/etc/hardware/config.json)

The above commands will flash BMC info and DMI code to the CSE/SuperMicro agreed settings.


Note that you will not see System/Product Serial or Chassis Serial in the DMI info. This is data will be populated with the HSB-91 updates on after a full reboot.
This may cause new failures because these pieces of information are missing, but we're working as fast as we can to get this code implemented.

If you absolutely need these values to get unblocked, please run:

./tatooine_hack_job

This will manually flash the DMI values that HSB-91 will provide to DMI.
